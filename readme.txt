File: mst.py
Author: Samy Masadi

The program finds minimum spanning trees using implementations of Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms. 
It is meant to compare each method's resulting MST and their performance times.

The program constructs a graph based on the city circuit data provided. It then applies both 
Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms to the graph to find the minimum spanning tree. In addition to 
outputting the results, it records the times taken by each algorithm and prints their 
performance for comparison.

Required for use: Python 3.0 or later version must be installed.
